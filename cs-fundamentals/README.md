# COMPUTER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS

### LEARNING YOUR FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

- Why programming language? (tool to communicate with computer to get it to do what we want)
- Components of a computer (RAM and ROM explain in detail, program is stored in ROM, program is ran in RAM)
- explain operating systems
- explain programming languages and types etc.
- explain compiling process (and interpreters)
- introduction to C and Python
- keywords, identifiers, variables, constants, I/O
- operators, precedence, associativity
- decision control statements (if/else, loops, nested loops and if/else)
- functions (all things about functions and scopes)
- arrays (all things about arrays and problems)
- strings (all things about strings and problems)
- pointers (everything about pointers)
- structures (in detail)
- reading and writing into files (C and python)
- preprocessor directives (C)
- OOPS concepts
- Error and exception handling


### BASICS OF DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

- data types, data structures, types of data structures, operations
- time complexity, trade offs,
- recursion (basics)
- sorting (all sorting algorithms)
- searching (linear search and binary search)
- linked lists (single, double, circular, operations, problems, and time complexities)
- stacks and queues (all kinds of implementations, time complexities, problems, priority queues)
- trees (traversals, representation, conversion of general trees to binary tree)
- binary search tree
- heaps
- graphs (dfs and bfs)
- hashing (collisions, linear probing, quadratic probing)
- balanced search trees
- analysis of algorithms, analysis of recursive algorithms
- greedy algorithms
- dynamic programming
- bit manipulation
- backtracking, branch and bound
- graph algorithms, shortest path, minimum spanning tree
- theory of np-completeness


### DATABASES

- database systems, purpose, view of data, database languages
- database design and entity relationship model
- relational model, relational algebra
- structured query language
- relational database design, indexing
- hash based indexing, transaction management and concurrency control
- deadlocks and recovery systems


### OPERATING SYSTEMS

- components of os, types, windows, linux
- processes and threads
- memory management
- inter process communication
- deadlocks
- virtual memory, file management, disk management
- I/O, linux, mobile OS

### COMPILER DESIGN

- introduction, phases of compilation, bootstrapping
- syntax analysis, lexer,
- semantic analysis, symbol table
- intermediate code generation
- target code generation
- in detail implementation

### NETWORKING

- introduction, overview
- TCP/IP, OSI protocol suite
- Data link layer
- LAN, network layer
- Transport layer
- Application layer
